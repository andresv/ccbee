/**
 * De-facto standard component for platform independent access to a serial port.
 *
 * This implementation supports the TI EM430 and other MSP430XV2-based boards.
 *
 * Note that, since the standard practice is to use StdControl to
 * start and stop this module (which requests and releases the
 * corresponding USCI UART module), inclusion of this into an
 * application is incompatible with sharing the UART among multiple
 * clients in the TEP108 sense of resource sharing.
