/** Top-level initialization of anything to do with the clock
 * subsystem.
 *
 * We mostly use the standard initialization in
 * Msp430XV2ClockControlP, except that we may or may not have an
 * external 32kHz crystal populated.
 *
 * If the PLATFORM_MSP430_HAS_XT1 preprocessor symbol is undefined, or is defined
 * to a non-zero value, the XIN and XOUT pins are configured to their
 * XT1 function.  The code loops up to 625ms waiting for XT1
 * stability.  If stability is not achieved, the XT1 functionality is
 * disabled.  Stabilization appears to take roughly 150ms, for the one
 * sample point I have available.
 *
 * If the PLATFORM_MSP430_HAS_XT1 preprocessor symbol is defined to zero, the XT1
 * functionality is left disabled per power-up, and no start-up delay
 * is incurred.
